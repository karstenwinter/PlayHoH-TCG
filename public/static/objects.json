Dates are often approximate and change as more research is done, reported and seen. Older examples of any given technology are found often. The locations listed are for the site where the earliest solid evidence has been found, but especially for the earlier inventions, there is little certainty how close that may be to where the invention took place.\n\n===Lower Paleolithic===\nThe Lower Paleolithic period lasted over 3 million years, and corresponds to the human species prior to the emergence of ''Homo sapiens''. The original divergence between humans and chimpanzees occurred 13 ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Mya]]), however interbreeding continued until as recently as 4 Ma, with the first species clearly belonging to the human (and not chimpanzee) lineage being ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]''.
