When the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]] switched support from the Mongols to the [[Tatar confederation|Tatars]] in 1161, they destroyed [[Khabul Khan]].{{sfn|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=9–10}}{{Sfn|Derenko |Malyarchuka |Wozniakb |Denisovaa |2007|p=5}}\n\nGenghis Khan's father, [[Yesügei]] (leader of the [[Kiyat]]-[[Borjigin]]<ref name=\"BRE\" /> clan and nephew to [[Ambaghai]] and [[Hotula Khan]]), emerged as the head of the ruling Mongol clan. This position was contested by the rival [[Tayichiud|Tayichi'ud]] clan, who descended directly from [[Ambaghai]].

The few sources that give insight into this period often contradict.\n\nTemüjin had three brothers [[Hasar]], [[Hachiun]], and [[Temüge]], one sister [[Temülen]], and two half-brothers Begter and [[Belgutei]]. Like many of the [[nomad]]s of Mongolia, Temüjin's early life was difficult.{{Sfn|Lee|2016|p=3}} His father [[arranged marriage|arranged a marriage]] for him and delivered him at age nine to the family of his future wife [[Börte]] of the tribe [[Khongirad]].

Upon learning this, Temüjin returned home to claim his father's position as chief, but the tribe refused him and abandoned the family, leaving it without protection.<ref>{{cite web |access-date = March 29, 2018 |url = https://manof300.com/genghis-khan-redefine-your-circumstances |title = Redefining Your Circumstances: Genghis Khan's Rise to Ruler of the World |publisher = Man of 300 |date = March 17, 2018 |archive-date = November 19, 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181119125446/https://manof300.com/genghis-khan-redefine-your-circumstances/ |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the next several years, the family lived in poverty, surviving mostly on wild fruits, ox [[Carrion|carcasses]], [[marmot]]s, and other small game killed by Temüjin and his brothers. Temüjin's older half-brother Begter began to exercise power as the eldest male in the family and would eventually have the right to claim Hoelun (who was not his own mother) as a wife.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=A8Y9B5uHQcAC&pg=PA23 23]}} Temüjin's resentment erupted during one hunting excursion when Temüjin and his brother [[Qasar|Khasar]] killed Begter.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=A8Y9B5uHQcAC&pg=PA23 23]}}\n\nIn a raid around 1177, Temüjin was captured by his father's former allies, the [[Tayichi'ud]], and enslaved, reportedly with a [[cangue]] (a sort of portable stocks). With the help of a sympathetic guard, he escaped from the [[Yurt|ger]] (yurt) at night by hiding in a river crevice.{{Sfn|Atwood|2004a|p=5}} The escape earned Temüjin a reputation. Soon, [[Jelme]] and [[Bo'orchu]] joined forces with him. They and the guard's son [[Chilaun]] eventually became generals of Genghis Khan.{{Sfn|Rachewiltz|2015|p=7}}\n\nAt this time, none of the tribal [[confederation]]s of Mongolia were united politically, and arranged marriages were often used to solidify temporary alliances.  Temüjin's mother Hoelun taught him many lessons, especially the need for strong [[military alliance|alliances]] to ensure stability in Mongolia.{{Sfn|Rachewiltz|2015|p=5}}\n\n=== Wives and concubines ===\n{{Main|Wives of Genghis Khan}}\nAs was common for powerful Mongol men, Genghis Khan had many wives and concubines.{{sfn|McLynn|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jcQzCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA169 169]}} These women were often queens or princesses that were taken captive from the territories he conquered or gifted to him by allies, vassals or other tribal acquaintances.{{sfn|Broadbridge|2018|pp=74, 92}}\n\nGenghis Khan gave several of his high-status wives their own ''ordos'' or camps to live in and manage. Each camp also contained junior wives, concubines, and even children. It was the job of the [[Kheshig]] (Mongol imperial guard) to protect the [[yurt]]s of Genghis Khan's wives. The guards had to pay particular attention to the individual yurt and camp in which Genghis Khan slept, which could change every night as he visited different wives.{{sfn|Broadbridge|2018|pp=14, 74, 104}}\n\nWhen Genghis Khan set out on his military conquests, he usually took one wife with him and left the rest of his wives (and concubines) to manage the empire in his absence.{{sfn|Broadbridge|2018|pp=19–20}} Genghis Khan's principal or most famous wives and concubines included: [[Börte]], [[Yesugen]], [[Yesui]], [[Khulan khatun]], [[Möge Khatun]], [[Juerbiesu]] and [[Ibaqa Beki]].\n\n== Uniting the Mongol confederations, 1184–1206 ==\n{{Main|Rise of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Mongolia XI.jpg|thumb|The locations of the Mongolian tribes during the Khitan [[Liao dynasty]] (907–1125)]]\nIn the early 12th century, the Central Asian plateau north of China was divided into several prominent tribal [[confederation]]s, including [[Naimans]], [[Merkit]]s, [[Tatar]]s, [[Khamag Mongol]]s, and [[Keraites]], that were often unfriendly towards each other, as evidenced by random raids, revenge attacks, and [[Looting|plundering]].\n\n=== Early attempts at power ===\nTemüjin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally (or, according to other sources, a [[vassal]]) to his father's ''anda'' (sworn brother or [[blood brother]]) [[Toghrul]], who was [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Keraites]]. This relationship was first reinforced when [[Börte]] was kidnapped by Merkits in around 1184. To win her back, Temüjin called on the support of Toghrul, who offered 20,000 of his Keraite warriors and suggested that Temüjin involve his childhood friend [[Jamukha]], who was Khan of his own tribe, the Jadaran.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grousset |first = Rene |title = Conqueror of the World: The Life of Chingis-khagan |location = New York, NY |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |year=1944 }}</ref>\n\n=== Rift with Jamukha and defeat ===\nAs [[Jamukha]] and Temüjin drifted apart in their friendship, each began consolidating power, and they became rivals. Jamukha supported the traditional [[Mongolian nobility|Mongolian aristocracy]], while Temüjin followed a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] method, and attracted a broader range and lower class of followers.{{sfn|Hildinger|1997|p=113}} Following his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the [[Shamanism|shaman]] [[Kokochu]] that the [[Tengrism|Eternal Blue Sky]] had set aside the world for Temüjin, Temüjin began rising to power.{{sfn|Hildinger|1997|p=114}} In 1186, Temüjin was elected khan of the [[Mongols]]. Threatened by this rise, Jamukha attacked Temujin in 1187 with an army of 30,000 troops. Temüjin gathered his followers to defend against the attack, but was decisively beaten in the [[Battle of Dalan Balzhut]].{{sfn|Hildinger|1997|p=114}}{{sfn|Lane|2004|p=xxvii}} However, Jamukha horrified and alienated potential followers by [[Death by boiling|boiling 70 young male captives alive]] in cauldrons.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{page needed|date=May 2020}}}} Toghrul, as Temüjin's patron, was exiled to the [[Qara Khitai]].{{sfn|Lane|2004|p=23}} The life of Temüjin for the next 10 years is unclear, as historical records are mostly silent on that period.{{sfn|Lane|2004|p=23}}\n\n=== Return to power ===\nAround the year 1197, the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] initiated an attack against their formal vassal, the [[Tatars]], with help from the [[Keraites]] and [[Mongols]]. Temüjin commanded part of this attack, and after victory, he and Toghrul were restored by the Jin to positions of power.{{sfn|Lane|2004|p=23}} The Jin bestowed Toghrul with the honorable title of Ong Khan, and Temüjin with a lesser title of ''j'aut quri''.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=35}}\n\nAround 1200, the main rivals of the [[Khamag Mongol|Mongol confederation]] (traditionally the \"Mongols\") were the [[Naimans]] to the west, the [[Merkit]]s to the north, the [[Tanguts]] to the south, and the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin]] to the east.\n\n[[File:Serven Khaalga Jurchen inscription.jpg|thumb|[[Jurchen script|Jurchen]] inscription (1196) in Mongolia relating to Genghis Khan's alliance with the Jin against the Tatars]]\n\nIn his rule and his conquest of rival tribes, Temüjin broke with Mongol tradition in a few crucial ways. He delegated authority based on merit and loyalty, rather than family ties.{{sfn|Weatherford|2004|p=44}} As an incentive for absolute obedience and the [[Yassa]] code of law, Temüjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future war spoils. When he defeated rival tribes, he did not drive away their soldiers and abandon their civilians. Instead, he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe. He would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe, bringing them into his family. These political innovations inspired great loyalty among the conquered people, making Temüjin stronger with each victory.{{sfn|Weatherford|2004|p=44}}\n\n=== Rift with Toghrul ===\n[[Senggum]], son of Toghrul (Wang Khan), envied Genghis Khan's growing power and affinity with his father. He allegedly planned to assassinate Genghis Khan. Although Toghrul was allegedly saved on multiple occasions by Genghis Khan, he gave in to his son{{sfn|Man|2007|p={{page needed|date=May 2020}}}} and became uncooperative with Genghis Khan. Genghis Khan learned of Senggum's intentions and eventually defeated him and his loyalists.\n\n[[File:Djengiz Khân et Toghril Ong Khan.jpeg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan and Toghrul Khan, illustration from a 15th-century [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] manuscript]]\n\nOne of the later ruptures between Genghis Khan and Toghrul was Toghrul's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to [[Jochi]], Genghis Khan's first son. This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Genghis Khan's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Genghis Khan, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|p=362}}\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Temüjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.{{sfn|Broadbridge|2018|p=89}} The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Genghis Khan.\n\nIn 1201, a [[Kurultai|Khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|Gür Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Genghis Khan, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Genghis Khan by his own men in 1206. {{citation needed|date =August 2020}}\n\nAccording to the ''Secret History'', Genghis Khan again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Genghis Khan had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.{{citation needed|date =August 2020}}\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains ===\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols. Illustration from a 15th-century [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] manuscript.]]\n[[File:Mongol Empire c.1207.png|thumb|Mongol Empire c. 1207]]The part of the [[Merkit]] clan that sided with the [[Naimans]] were defeated by [[Subutai]], who was by then a member of Genghis Khan's personal guard and later became one of Genghis Khan's most successful [[commander]]s. The Naimans' defeat left Genghis Khan as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] – all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Genghis Khan's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Genghis Khan had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur_Khaganate#Successors|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Genghis Khan was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new [[#Name and title|title]] \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor Ögedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\nAccording to the Secret History of the Mongols, the chieftains of the conquered tribes pledged to Genghis Khan by proclaiming:<blockquote>\"We will make you Khan; you shall ride at our head, against our foes. We will throw ourselves like lightning on your enemies. We will bring you their finest women and girls, their rich tents like palaces.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hyslop|first1=Stephen Garrison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KK2TikRZJpsC|title=Great Empires: An Illustrated Atlas|last2=Daniels|first2=Patricia|last3=Society (U.S.)|first3=National Geographic|date=2011|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0829-4|pages=174, 179}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cummins |first=Joseph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYfTZiQPD5cC|title=History's Greatest Wars: The Epic Conflicts that Shaped the Modern World|date=2011-05-01|publisher=Fair Winds Press|isbn=978-1-61058-055-7|pages=95}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Military campaigns, 1207–1227 ==\n{{Campaignbox Genghis Khan's Campaigns}}\n{{Further|Mongol invasions and conquests}}\n\n=== Western Xia Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Western Xia}}\n\nDuring the 1206 political rise of Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire created by Genghis Khan and his allies shared its western borders with the  of the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]] dynasty.

In 1207, Genghis led another raid into Western Xia, invading the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos region]] and sacking [[Wuhai]], the main garrison along the [[Yellow River]], before withdrawing in 1208.

Luckily for the Mongols, Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army made several tactical mistakes, including avoiding attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity using his overwhelming numerical superiority, and instead initially fortifying behind the Great wall. At the subsequent [[Battle of Yehuling]], which the Jin commander later committed to in the hope of using the mountainous terrain to his advantage against the Mongols, the general's emissary [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]] defected to the Mongol side and instead handed over intelligence on the movements of the Jin army, which was subsequently outmanoeuvred, resulting in hundreds of thousands of Jin casualties. <!--Decades later, when the [[Taoism|Taoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass.

This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son, Ögedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Temüjin defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered [[Khwarezmia|Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.<ref>Stephen Pow: ''The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan.''

Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. Genghis Khan and his family and commanders [[ortogh|invested]] in the caravan gold, silver, silk, various kinds of textiles and fabrics and pelts to trade with the Muslim traders in the Khwarazmian lands.<ref>[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02634937.2019.1652799 Enerelt Enkhbold, 2019. \"The role of the ''ortoq'' in the Mongol Empire in forming business partnerships\", ''Central Asian Survey'' 38 (4), 1–17]</ref> However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[Ögedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to [[Battle of the Indus|ford the Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions.\n\nNext, Genghis Khan [[Siege of Bukhara|besieged the city of Bukhara]]. [[Bukhara]] was not heavily fortified, with just a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. The survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery.{{sfn|Morgan|1986|p={{page needed|date=May 2020}}}} After the surrender of Bukhara, Genghis Khan also took the unprecedented step of personally entering the city, after which he had the city's aristocrats and elites brought to the mosque, where, through interpreters, he lectured them on their misdeeds, saying: \"If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.\"{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{pn|date=August 2021}}}}\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nWith the capture of Bukhara, the way was clear for the Mongols to advance on the capital of [[Samarkand]], which possessed significantly better fortifications and a larger garrison compared to Bukhara. To overcome the city, the Mongols engaged in intensive psychological warfare, including the use of captured Khwarazmian prisoners as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis executed every soldier that had taken arms against him. According to the Persian historian [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], the people of Samarkand were then ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">{{cite web|first=George|last=Modelski|date=September 29, 2007|title=Central Asian world cities? |url=https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm|archive-date=January 18, 2012|publisher=University of Washington}}</ref> Similarly, Juvayni wrote that in the city [[Termez]], to the south of [[Samarkand]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nJuvayni's account of mass killings at these sites is not corroborated by modern archaeology. Instead of killing local populations, the Mongols tended to enslave the conquered and either send them to Mongolia to act as menial labor or retain them for use in the war effort. The effect was still mass depopulation.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{pn|date=August 2021}}}} The piling of a \"pyramid of severed heads\" happened not at [[Samarkand]] but at [[Nishapur]], where Genghis Khan's son-in-law [[Toquchar]] was killed by an arrow shot from the city walls after the residents revolted. The Khan then allowed his widowed daughter, who was pregnant at the time, to decide the fate of the city, and she decreed that the entire population be killed. She also supposedly ordered that every dog, cat and any other animals in the city by slaughtered, \"so that no living thing would survive the murder of her husband\".{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{pn|date=August 2021}}}} The sentence was duly carried out by the Khan's youngest son [[Tolui]].<ref name=\"Nishapur\">[https://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/genghis-khan-murder.htm The Truth About Nishapur] How Stuff Works. Retrieved April 27, 2021</ref> According to widely circulated but unverified stories, the severed heads were then erected in separate piles for the men, women and children.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{pn|date=August 2021}}}}\n\nNear to the end of the battle for [[Samarkand]], the Shah fled rather than surrender. Genghis Khan subsequently ordered two of his generals, [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]], to destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island in the Caspian Sea that he had retreated to with his remaining loyal forces.\n\nMeanwhile, the wealthy trading city of [[Konya-Urgench|Urgench]] was still in the hands of Khwarazmian forces. The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. These numbers are considered logistically implausible by modern scholars, but the sacking of Urgench was no doubt a bloody affair.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{pn|date=August 2021}}}}\n\n=== Georgia, Crimea, Kievan Rus and Volga Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n\n[[File:Gold coin of Genghis Khan, struck at the Ghazna (Ghazni) mint.jpg|thumb|Gold ''[[gold dinar|dinar]]'' of Genghis Khan, struck at the [[Ghazni|Ghazna]] (Ghazni) mint, dated 1221/2]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Armenia]] to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]–[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some {{convert|1100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref> Various historical secondary sources – Morgan, Chambers, Grousset – state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. Not only had the Rus put up strong resistance, but also Jebe – with whom Subutai had campaigned for years – had been killed just prior to the Battle of Kalka River.<ref>Stephen Pow: ''The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan.'' In: ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.'' Vol. 27, Nr. 1. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2017, S. 31–51 (englisch).</ref> As was customary in Mongol society for nobility, the Russian princes were given a bloodless death. Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly in Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County]], [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut royal lineage.\n\n== Death and succession ==\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\n{{Main|Tomb of Genghis Khan}}\nGenghis Khan died within eight days of setting off for his final campaign against the [[Western Xia]] on 18 August 1227, according to the official ''History of Yuan'' commissioned during China's Ming dynasty.<ref name=Cho21>{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/genghis-khan-death-cause-revealed.html |title=The story you heard about Genghis Khan's death is probably all wrong |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=3 February 2021 |publisher=Live Science}}</ref> The date of his death is therefore said to have fallen on 25 August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]].

According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\nBefore Genghis Khan died, he assigned [[Ögedei Khan]] as his successor. Genghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[Ögedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each. The title of Great Khan passed to [[Ögedei]], the third son of Genghis Khan, making him the second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi,  died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Chagatai, Genghis Khan's second son was meanwhile passed over, according to ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', over a row just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] in which Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor due to questions about his elder brother's parentage.

The Mongol Empire did not emphasize the importance of [[ethnicity]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] in the administrative realm, instead adopting an approach grounded in [[meritocracy]].{{sfn|Weatherford|2004|p={{pn|date=August 2021}}}} The Mongol Empire was one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse empires in history, as befitted its size. Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including the [[Mongols|Mongol]] people, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples, and others. There were [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various non-Mongolian ethnicities such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.<ref>{{cite book|author=Amy Chua |title=Day of Empire: How hyperpowers rise to global dominance, and why they fall |place=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |page=95}}</ref> Genghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions.

Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] (Mongol Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yelü Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had risen to power by displacing the Khitan people. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications.

Edison was legally credited with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.\n\n[[William Joseph Hammer]], a consulting [[electrical engineer]], started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|iron ore separator]], [[incandescent light bulb|electric lighting]], and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see [[Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps]]). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager [[Francis Robbins Upton]] turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Thomas Edison: Life of an Electrifying Man |last=Biographiq |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-59986-216-3 |page=9 |publisher=Filiquarian Publishing}}</ref> {{anchor|sprague}}[[Frank J.

Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of [[Ohm's Law]], [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] and economics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/ |title=The Thomas A.

A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.\n\nUp to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by [[Johann Philipp Reis]] and [[Alexander Graham Bell]], worked by generating a weak current. The [[carbon microphone]] works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it.<ref name=\"Adrian Hope 1102, page 378\">Adrian Hope, 100 Years of Microphone, New Scientist May 11, 1978 Vol. 78, No. 1102, p. 378 {{ISSN|0262-4079}}</ref> His work was concurrent with [[Emile Berliner]]'s loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitter's invention<ref name=\"IEEE\">''IEEE Global History Network: Carbon Transmitter''.

The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing [[overhead lines|overhead wires]] began service in [[Roselle, New Jersey]].\n\n===War of currents===\n{{Main|War of the currents}}\n[[File:PyramidParthenon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Extravagant displays of electric lights quickly became a feature of public events, as in this picture from the 1897 [[Tennessee Centennial Exposition]].]]\nAs Edison expanded his [[direct current]] (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing [[alternating current]] (AC) systems. From the early 1880s, AC [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of [[transformer]]s in Europe and by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \"step down\" (reduce) the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison's patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply.<ref>Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House – 2004, pp. 54–60</ref> Edison's DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison's DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\n\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As [[George Westinghouse]] installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \"''Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.''\"<ref>Maury Klein, ''The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America'', Bloomsbury Publishing US – 2008, p. 257</ref> Many reasons have been suggested for Edison's anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general.<ref>''Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The Country'' By Jill Jonnes p. 146</ref> Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison's mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nq0Le9FfXlAC&q=Thomson+Houston+westinghouse+edison+1887&pg=PT68|title=Edison to Enron|isbn=978-1-118-19251-1|last1=Robert l.

This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it.<ref>Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House – 2004, p. 143</ref><ref>Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing US – 2009, pp. 139–140</ref> Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader [[Harold P. Brown]] in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a [[War of the currents|\"battle of currents\"]]. The development of the [[electric chair]] was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and [[Smear campaign|smear]] Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\n\nThomas Edison's staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison's company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier [[J.P. Morgan]] engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called [[General Electric]]. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.<ref>Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing US – 2009, p. 268</ref><ref>Robert L.

High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the [[Edison Ore-Milling Company|Edison Ore Milling Company]], Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm#Cement|title=Edison's Companies – The Edison Papers|access-date=December 30, 2016|archive-date=October 8, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008140933/http://edison.rutgers.edu/list.htm#Cement|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment.

His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&lang=en&currID=2031&parID=2029 |title=Thomas Edison |access-date=December 30, 2007 |work=[[Greater Sudbury Heritage Museums]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5umTghSyU?url=http://www.sudburymuseums.ca/index.cfm?app=w_vmuseum&lang=en&currID=2031&parID=2029 |archive-date=December 6, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A street in Falconbridge, as well as the [[Edison Building (Falconbridge)|Edison Building]], which served as the head office of [[Falconbridge Ltd.|Falconbridge Mines]], are named for him.\n\n===Rechargeable battery===\n{{Further|Nickel–iron battery#History}}\n[[File:Edison Storage Battery Company 1903.JPG|thumb|Share of the Edison Storage Battery Company, issued October 19, 1903]]\nIn the late 1890s, Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient [[rechargeable battery]] (at that time called an \"accumulator\"). He looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including [[electric car|electric automobiles]].<ref>David John Cole, Eve Browning, Eve Browning Cole, Fred E. H. Schroeder, Encyclopedia of Modern Everyday Inventions, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, pages 45-46</ref> The then available [[Lead–acid battery|lead acid rechargeable batteries]] were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so Edison pursued using [[alkali]]ne instead of acid. He had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. Besides his experimenting Edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a [[nickel–iron battery]] by the Swedish inventor [[Waldemar Jungner]].<ref name=\"Seth Fletcher 2011, pages 14-16\">Seth Fletcher, Bottled Lightning: Superbatteries, Electric Cars, and the New Lithium Economy, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, May 10, 2011, pages 14-16</ref>\n\nEdison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel–iron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company, and by 1904 it had 450 people working there. The first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects, with customers complaining about the product. When the capital of the company was exhausted, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel–iron battery was never very successful; by the time it was ready, electric cars were disappearing, and lead acid batteries had become the standard for turning over gas-powered car [[Starter (engine)|starter motors]].<ref name=\"Seth Fletcher 2011, pages 14-16\"/>\n\n===Chemicals===\n\nAt the start of [[World War I]], the American chemical industry was primitive.  Most chemicals were imported from Europe.  The outbreak of war in August 1914 resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals.  One of particular importance to Edison was [[phenol]], which was used to make [[phonograph]] records—presumably as [[phenolic resins]] of the [[Bakelite]] type.\n\nAt the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of [[coke oven]] gases or [[manufactured gas]] for [[gas lighting]].  Phenol could be nitrated to [[picric acid]] and converted to [[ammonium picrate]], a shock resistant [[high explosive]] suitable for use in artillery shells.  A telling of the phenol story is found in ''The Aspirin Wars''.<ref>Mann, Charles C. And Plummer, Mark L (1991). ''The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine, and 100 Years of Rampant Competition''. Alfred A. Knopf, NY, {{ISBN|0-394-57894-5}}, pp. 38–40</ref> Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.\n\nEdison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake facility using processes developed by his chemists.<ref>Conot, Robert (1979), ''A Streak of Luck: The Life & Legend of Thomas Alva Edison'', Seaview Books, NY, pp. 413–414</ref> He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  He built two plants to produce raw material [[benzene]] at [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], and [[Bessemer, Alabama]], replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured [[aniline dyes]], which previously had been supplied by the German dye trust.  Other wartime products include [[xylene]], [[p-phenylenediamine]], [[shellac]], and pyrax.  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.\n\nPhenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. [[Bakelite]], the original [[thermoset]] plastic, had been invented in 1909. [[Aspirin]], too was a phenol derivative.  Invented in 1899, it had become a block buster drug. [[Bayer]] had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in [[Rensselaer, New York]], but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war.  Edison was able to oblige.\n\nBayer relied on Chemische Fabrik von Heyden, in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]], to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin.  (See Great Phenol plot.) It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of [[ammonium picrate]].  Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses.

[[Ft. Myers]], Florida, February 11, 1929]]\n\n[[Henry Ford]], the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the [[DTE Electric Company|Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit]] and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. [[Harvey Firestone]] and naturalist [[John Burroughs]] also participated.\n\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers [[Civitan International|Civitan Club]]. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \"The Civitan Club is doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Armbrester |first= Margaret E. |title= The Civitan Story |year= 1992 |publisher=Ebsco Media |location= Birmingham, AL |page= 34 }}</ref> He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club's meetings.\n\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna Railroad]] inaugurated suburban electric train service from [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] to [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]], [[Dover, New Jersey|Dover]], and [[Gladstone, New Jersey]]. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to [[South Orange, NJ|South Orange]].<ref name=\"Holland 2001\">{{Holland-Classic}}</ref>\n\nThis fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984.

Einstein is best known for developing the [[theory of relativity]], but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of [[modern physics]].<ref name=\"frs\" /><ref name=\"YangHamilton2010\" /> His [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula {{math|1=[[Mass–energy equivalence#Mass–velocity relationship|''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>]]}}, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\".<ref name=\"LnLVo\" /> His work is also known for its influence on the [[philosophy of science]].<ref name=\"xZQWt\" /><ref name=\"3UiiT\" /> He received the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the [[photoelectric effect]]\",<ref name=\"Nobel Prize\" /> a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\".<ref name=\"wordnetweb.princeton.edu\" />\n\nIn 1905, a year sometimes described as his ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' ('miracle year'), Einstein published [[Annus Mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]].{{sfnp|Galison|2000|p=377}} These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained [[Brownian motion]], introduced [[special relativity]], and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of [[classical mechanics]] could no longer be reconciled with those of the [[electromagnetic field]], which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on [[general relativity]] in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.<ref name=\"Nobel\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20151124\" /> He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light.\n\nHowever, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that nature \"does not play dice\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4 |title=Did Einstein really say that? |last=Robinson |first=Andrew |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=30 April 2018 |volume=557 |number=30 |page=30 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-05004-4 |bibcode=2018Natur.557...30R |s2cid=14013938 |access-date=21 February 2021 |archive-date=9 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109033021/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4 |url-status=live }}</ref> Second, he attempted to devise a [[unified field theory]] by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.\n\nEinstein was born in the [[German Empire]], but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]])<ref group=note name=GEcitizen /> the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss [[ETH Zurich|Federal polytechnic school]] in [[Zürich]], graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property|Swiss Patent Office]] in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Zurich]]. In 1914, Einstein moved to [[Berlin]] in order to join the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. In 1917, Einstein became director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics]]; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian.\n\nIn 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in Germany. Einstein, of Jewish origin, objected to the policies of the newly elected [[Nazi Germany|Nazi government]];<ref name=\"zE9Bz\" /> he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.<ref name=\"BoyerDubofsky2001\" /> On the eve of [[World War II]], he endorsed [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|a letter]] to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] alerting him to the potential [[German nuclear weapons program]] and recommending that the US begin [[Manhattan Project|similar research]].

In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded ''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie'', a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n\nAlbert attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59 59–61]}}\n\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the [[direct current]] (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref name=\"EQyag\" /> The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method.

In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]], who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his {{w|Cromer}} home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of {{w|Roughton, Norfolk}}. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the ''Daily Herald'' on 24 July 1933.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=422}}<ref name=\"3zIp7\" />\n\nLocker-Lampson took Einstein to meet [[Winston Churchill]] at his home, and later, [[Austen Chamberlain]] and former Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=419–420}} Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany.

His views were not shared by the majority of Jews seeking to form a new country; as a result, Einstein was limited to a marginal role in the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Ze'ev |last=Rosenkranz |date=2011 |title=Einstein Before Israel: Zionist Icon Or Iconoclast? |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=4–5 |isbn=978-0-691-14412-2}}</ref>\n\nChaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of [[Ezriel Carlebach]], Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] offered Einstein the position of [[President of Israel]], a mostly ceremonial post.<ref name=\"Time\" /><ref name=\"Msb2q\" /> The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, [[Abba Eban]], who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\".{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}} Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \"deeply moved\", and \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that he could not accept it.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=522}}\n\n==== Love of music ====\n[[File:Rabindranath with Einstein.jpg|thumb|Albert Einstein (right) with writer, musician and Nobel laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], 1930]]\nEinstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote: \"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music.\"<ref name=\"BQH5A\" /><ref name=\"aBOjz\" />\n\nHis mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the [[violin]], not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into [[German culture]]. According to conductor [[Leon Botstein]], Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\n\nWhen he turned 13, he discovered the [[Mozart violin sonatas|violin sonatas of Mozart]], whereupon he became enamored of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". He said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.\"<ref name=\"Botstein\" /> At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing [[Beethoven's violin sonatas (disambiguation)<!-- intentional -->|Beethoven's violin sonatas]]. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was \"remarkable and revealing of 'great insight{{' \"}}. What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\"<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\n\nMusic took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played [[chamber music]] were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the [[Köchel catalog]] of Mozart's work; that edition was prepared by [[Alfred Einstein]], who may have been a distant relation.<ref name=\"kGuWC\" /><ref name=\"OIn6p\" />\n\nIn 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and Mozart's works with members of the [[Zoellner Quartet]].<ref name=\"Times\" /><ref name=\"RR\" /> Near the end of his life, when the young [[Juilliard Quartet]] visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was \"impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation\".<ref name=\"Botstein\" />\n\n==== Political views ====\n{{Main|Political views of Albert Einstein}}\n[[File:Einsteinwiezmann.PNG|alt=Casual group shot of four men and two women standing on a brick pavement.|thumb|Albert Einstein with his wife [[Elsa Einstein]] and Zionist leaders, including future [[President of Israel]] [[Chaim Weizmann]], his wife [[Vera Weizmann]], [[Menahem Ussishkin]], and Ben-Zion Mossinson on arrival in New York City in 1921]]\n\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the [[German Democratic Party]], a [[Liberalism|liberal]] party.{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2007|p=83}} Later in his life, Einstein's political view was in favor of [[socialism]] and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"[[Why Socialism?]]\"{{sfnp|Einstein|1949}}<ref name=\"LXsUJ\" /> His opinions on the [[Bolsheviks]] also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a 'well-regulated system of government' and called their rule a 'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history'. He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on [[Vladimir Lenin]]: \"In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind's conscience.\"{{sfnp|Rowe|Schulmann|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_X1dAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA413 412, 413]}} Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.{{Sfnp|Clark|1971}} He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic [[global government]] that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|pp=487, 494, 550}} He wrote \"I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself.\"<ref>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 4 (February 1948), No. 2 35–37: 'A Reply to the Soviet Scientists, December 1947'</ref> The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.<ref name=\"ixWWZ\" />\n\nEinstein was deeply impressed by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], with whom he exchanged written letters. He described Gandhi as \"a role model for the generations to come\".<ref name=\"Albano-Müller\" /> The initial connection was established on 27 September 1931, when [[Wilfrid Israel]] took his Indian guest [[V. A. Sundaram]] to meet his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh. Sundaram was Gandhi's disciple and special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leader's home in 1925. During the visit, Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy, and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through Wilfrid Israel.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://streams.gandhiserve.org/einstein.html| title = Einstein's letter and Gandhi's answer| access-date = 22 August 2021| archive-date = 9 June 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140609031152/http://streams.gandhiserve.org/einstein.html| url-status = live}}, gandhiserve.org</ref>\n\n==== Religious and philosophical views ====\n{{Main|Religious and philosophical views of Albert Einstein}}\nEinstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews.<ref name=\"018QJ\" /> He said he had sympathy for the impersonal [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] God of [[Spinozism|Baruch Spinoza's philosophy]].{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&pg=PA325 325]}} He did not believe in a [[personal god]] who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve.{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2000|p=218}} He clarified, however, that \"I am not an atheist\",{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdxWNE7NY6QC&pg=PT390 390]}} preferring to call himself an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=G_iziBAPXtEC&pg=PA340 340]}}<ref name=\"flickr2687\" /> or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\".{{Sfnp|Calaprice|2000|p=218}} When asked if he believed in an [[afterlife]], Einstein replied, \"No. And one life is enough for me.\"{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OzSJgdwk5esC&pg=PT461 461]}}\n\nEinstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious [[Secular humanist|humanist]] and [[Ethical Culture]] groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the [[First Humanist Society of New York]],<ref name=\"mKToJ\" /> and was an honorary associate of the [[Rationalist Association]], which publishes ''[[New Humanist]]'' in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the [[New York Society for Ethical Culture]], he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \"Without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.\"{{sfnp|Einstein|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9fJkBqwDD3sC&pg=PA62 62]}}\n\nIn a German-language letter to philosopher [[Eric Gutkind]], dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:<blockquote>[[God (word)|The word God]] is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the [[Bible]] a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the [[Jewish religion]] like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions.

These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of [[History of physics#Modern physics|modern physics]] and changed views on [[space]], time, and [[matter]].

It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.<ref name=\"PubList\" />\n\n==== Theory of critical opalescence ====\n{{Main|Critical opalescence}}\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref name=\"L2N73\" /> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\n\n=== Special relativity ===\n{{Main|History of special relativity}}\nEinstein's \"''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper''\"{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}} (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between [[Maxwell's equations]] (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics.{{Sfnp|Fölsing|1997|pp=178–198}} Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the [[speed of light]]). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity. There is evidence from Einstein's writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. The decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown.<ref name=\"mileva\" />\n\nThis paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to [[Time dilation|slow down]], and the body itself would [[Length contraction|contract]] in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"aBfxO\" />\n\nIn his paper on [[mass–energy equivalence]], Einstein produced ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''<sup>2</sup> as a consequence of his special relativity equations.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=vi, 15, 90, 131, [https://books.google.com/?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA215 215]}} Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].<ref group=note name=\"sBl2q\" />{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=382–386}}\n\nEinstein originally framed special relativity in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]] reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of [[spacetime]]. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=151–152}}\n\n=== General relativity ===\n\n==== General relativity and the equivalence principle ====\n{{Main|History of general relativity}}\n{{See also|Theory of relativity|Einstein field equations}}\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\n\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational redshift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179–183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900–1909|pp=273–274}}\n\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194–195}}\n\n==== Gravitational waves ====\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,{{sfnp|Einstein|1916}}{{sfnp|Einstein|1918}} ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its [[Lorentz invariance]] which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]], which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\n\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting [[neutron stars]], [[PSR B1913+16]].<ref name=\"natgeo\" /> The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /><ref name=\"Tf1T0\" /> Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at [[LIGO]] published the [[first observation of gravitational waves]],<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\" /> detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.<ref name=\"natgeo\" /><ref name=\"CO6kH\" /><ref name=\"oSmHb\" /><ref name=\"hkKSp\" /><ref name=\"38Msx\" />\n\n==== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ====\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\n\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref name=\"sOA9t\" /> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\n\n==== Physical cosmology ====\n{{Main|Physical cosmology}}\n[[File:MillikanLemaitreEinstein.jpg|thumb|right|Einstein with [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Millikan]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in January 1933.]]\n\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of [[Mach's principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein's static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285–286}}<ref name=\"iJwuX\" />\n\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]] of 1931{{sfnp|Einstein|1931}}<ref name=\"cor-2013\" /> and the [[Einstein–de Sitter universe]] of 1932.{{sfnp|Einstein|de Sitter|1932}}<ref name=\"J9Tqu\" /> In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\".{{sfnp|Einstein|1931}}<ref name=\"cor-2013\" /><ref name=\"sxfvo\" />\n\nIn many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\". The astrophysicist [[Mario Livio]] has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.<ref name=\"qmmVf\" />\n\nIn late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist [[Cormac O'Raifeartaigh]] discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the universe.<ref name=\"Tq53z\" /><ref name=\"8pfEk\" /> In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant.<ref name=\"cor-steady-state\" /><ref name=\"Einstein's aborted model\" /> As he stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel's [''sic''] facts, and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\"\n\nIt thus appears that Einstein considered a [[Steady State theory|steady-state model]] of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold.<ref name=\"ILjYQ\" /><ref name=\"ThZb0\" /> However, Einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.<ref name=\"cor-steady-state\" /><ref name=\"Einstein's aborted model\" /><ref name=\"7ShC9\" />\n\n==== Energy momentum pseudotensor ====\n{{Main|Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor}}\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\n\nEinstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.\n\nThe use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and others.\n\n==== Wormholes ====\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein–Rosen bridges]].{{sfnp|Einstein|Rosen|1935}}<ref name=\"QNjpt\" /> His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.<ref name=\"ja7FY\" />\n\nIf one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.\n\n==== Einstein–Cartan theory ====\n{{Main|Einstein–Cartan theory}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\n\n==== Equations of motion ====\n{{Main|Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations}}\nThe theory of general relativity has a fundamental law{{mdash}}the [[Einstein field equations]], which describe how space curves. The [[geodesic equation]], which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations.\n\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\n\nThis was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.\n\n=== Old quantum theory ===\n{{Main|Old quantum theory}}\n\n==== Photons and energy quanta ====\n[[File:Photoelectric effect in a solid - diagram.svg|alt=|thumb|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]\nIn a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (''[[quantum|quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].\n\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}\n\n==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====\n{{Main|Einstein solid}}\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref name=\"ixm32\" />\n\n==== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ====\n{{Main|Adiabatic invariant}}\nThroughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].\n\nEinstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.\n\n==== Bose–Einstein statistics ====\n{{Main|Bose–Einstein statistics}}\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]–[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].<ref name=\"nlagl\" /> Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.<ref name=\"Instituut-Lorentz\" />\n\n==== Wave–particle duality ====\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein during his visit to the United States]]\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}} In \"''Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''\" (\"[[s:Translation:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]\"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave–particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\n\n==== Zero-point energy ====\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of [[zero-point energy]] in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel et al.|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912–1914|pp=270ff}}\n\n==== Stimulated emission ====\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.\n\n==== Matter waves ====\nEinstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.\n\n=== Quantum mechanics ===\n==== Einstein's objections to quantum mechanics ====\n[[File:NYT May 4, 1935.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper headline on 4 May 1935]]\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\".<ref name=\"zZ2hS\" /> Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.<ref name=\"yzZtL\" />\n\n==== Bohr versus Einstein ====\n{{Main|Bohr–Einstein debates}}\n[[File:Niels Bohr Albert Einstein by Ehrenfest.jpg|upright|alt=Two men sitting, looking relaxed. A dark-haired Bohr is talking while Einstein looks skeptical.|thumb|Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], 1925]] The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about [[quantum mechanics]] between Einstein and [[Niels Bohr]], who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the [[philosophy of science]].<ref name=\"Bohr1949\" />{{Sfnp|Einstein|1969}}{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} Their debates would influence later [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].\n\n==== Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ====\n{{Main|EPR paradox}}\nIn 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in a collaboration with [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]] that laid out what would become known as the [[EPR paradox]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|Podolsky|Rosen|1935}} In a [[Einstein's thought experiments|thought experiment]], they considered two particles, which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448–453}}\n\nGiven Einstein's concept of [[local realism]], there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\").{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|loc=pp. 448–453}}\n\nEinstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which [[J. S. Bell]] had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\"{{Sfnp|Penrose|2007|p=583}}\n\nAlthough Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum states]], has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the most influential papers published in ''[[Physical Review]]''. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of [[quantum information theory]].{{Sfnp|Fine|2017}}\n\n=== Unified field theory ===\n{{Main|Classical unified field theories}}\nFollowing his research on general relativity, Einstein attempted to generalize his theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"[[unified field theory]]\" in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he was lauded for this work, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\nNotably, Einstein's unification project did not accommodate the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, neither of which were well understood until many years after his death. Although mainstream physics long ignored Einstein's approaches to unification, Einstein's work has motivated modern quests for a [[theory of everything]], in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.\n\n=== Other investigations ===\n{{Main|Einstein's unsuccessful investigations}}\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], and other research.\n\n=== Collaboration with other scientists ===\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world's top physicists. Einstein is in the center.]]\nIn addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\n\n==== Einstein–de Haas experiment ====\n{{Main|Einstein–de Haas effect}}\nEinstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\n\n==== Schrödinger gas model ====\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThis formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref name=\"4IMf2\" />\n\n==== Einstein refrigerator ====\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]]. This [[absorption refrigerator]] was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input.<ref name=\"Goettling\" /> On 11 November 1930, {{US patent|1781541}} was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company [[Electrolux]].{{refn |group=note |In September 2008 it was reported that Malcolm McCulloch of Oxford University was heading a three-year project to develop more robust appliances that could be used in locales lacking electricity, and that his team had completed a prototype Einstein refrigerator. He was quoted as saying that improving the design and changing the types of gases used might allow the design's efficiency to be quadrupled.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Alok |first=Jha |title=Einstein fridge design can help global cooling |work=The Guardian |date=21 September 2008 |access-date=22 February 2011 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124172925/http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/sep/21/scienceofclimatechange.climatechange |archive-date=24 January 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\n== Non-scientific legacy ==\n[[File:Einstein-Oslofjord (cropped).jpg|thumb|Einstein (second from left) at a picnic in Oslo during the visit to Denmark and Norway in 1920.

The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986<ref name=\"margot-obituary\" />).

In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His [[alternating current]] (AC) [[induction motor]] and related [[polyphase system|polyphase]] AC patents, licensed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\n\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of [[wireless communication]] with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.<ref name=\"tsteslatower\">{{cite web|title=Tesla Tower in Shoreham Long Island (1901–1917) meant to be the 'World Wireless' Broadcasting system|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslatower.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills.

The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the [[Ivry-sur-Seine]] suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating [[dynamo]]s and motors.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=63–64}} They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.\n\n=== Moving to the United States ===\n[[File:Edison machine works goerck street new york 1881.png|thumb|Edison Machine Works on Goerck Street, New York.

Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system.

Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=205–206}} It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.\n\n=== Lab fire ===\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?\" After the fire Tesla moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.\n\n=== X-ray experimentation ===\n[[File:Рэнтгенаўскі здымак рукі Тэслы.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|X-ray Tesla took of his hand]]\n\nStarting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as [[radiant energy]] of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tesla|first1=Nikola|title=X-ray vision: Nikola Tesla on Roentgen rays|date=2007|publisher=Wiilder Publications|location=Radford, VA|isbn=978-1-934451-92-2|edition=1st}}</ref> (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"[[X-Rays]]\"). His early experiments were with [[Crookes tube]]s, a [[cold cathode]] electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]'s December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a [[Geissler tube]], an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=134}}\n\n[[File:Tesla boat1.jpg|thumb|upright|In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a radio-controlled boat which he hoped to sell as a guided torpedo to navies around the world.<ref>W.

In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the \"instrument will&nbsp;... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Nikola |last=Tesla |url=http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1898-11-17.htm |chapter=High Frequency Oscillators for Electro-Therapeutic and Other Purposes |title=Proceedings of the American Electro-Therapeutic Association |publisher=American Electro-Therapeutic Association |page=25 |date=17 November 1898}}</ref>\n\nTesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the [[ozone]] generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by [[nitrous acid]]. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in [[waves in plasmas]]. These plasma waves can occur in [[force-free magnetic field]]s.<ref>Griffiths, David J.

It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.\n\nAt the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power.

Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a \"master race\" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated:\n\n{{blockquote|...&nbsp;man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct&nbsp;...
